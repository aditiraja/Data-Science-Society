I designed and developed an analytics project with a team of three others to determine the biggest factors of mental health issues in the technology industry and presented the findings at a research symposium. I processed and visualized the dataset with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I also performed a variety of tests on the dataset such as hypthosis testing and A/B testing.
